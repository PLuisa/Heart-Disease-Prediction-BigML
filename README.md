# Heart Disease Prediction using BigML

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)** through the **BigML** platform to predict heart disease risk using supervised learning algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle - [Heart Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction)  
- **Size:** 299 patient records  
- **Features:** Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, etc.  

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Checked missing values, data types, and distributions.
2. **Modeling**: Used a **Decision Tree** in BigML for classification.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Trained on **80% of data**, tested on **20%**.
4. **Results**: Achieved **97.07% accuracy**, analyzed confusion matrix and feature importance.

## 📌 Key Results
- **Feature Importance:** Chest pain type (**cp**) was the most significant predictor.
- **Performance:** The model demonstrated high accuracy.
- **BigML Strengths:** Easy-to-use, no-code ML model creation.
